The browser extension only tracks the following: question number, section number, question content, whether you answered the question correctly/incorrectly. This data is completely visible in the extension LocalStorage. Data will be stored only locally in your browser unless you choose to send it for analysis (paid service), in which case you will have to provide an email and a paid registration key (coming soon). In that case, a Google spreadsheet with the analysis will be shared with your email within 24 hours.
